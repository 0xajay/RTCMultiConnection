<section>
    <p>This property was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this property is also removed.</p>
    <p>Note: SCTP is default and the only implementation on v3 and newer releases. RTP data channels are no more supported.</p>
