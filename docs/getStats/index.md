    <p>This method was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this method is also removed.</p>
    <p>Here is a demo that explains how to use getStats API: <a href="http://rtcmulticonnection.herokuapp.com/demos/getStats.html">demos/getStats.html</a></p>
