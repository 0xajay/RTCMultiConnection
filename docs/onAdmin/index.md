    <p>This method was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this method is also removed.</p>
    <p>Please check a live demo here: <a href="https://rtcmulticonnection.herokuapp.com/demos/admin-guest.html">demos/admin-guest.html</a></p>
