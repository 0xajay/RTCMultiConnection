    <p>This method was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this method is also removed.</p>
    <p>Please check RecordRTC instead: <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC">https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC</a></p>
