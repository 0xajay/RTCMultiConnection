    <p>This method was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this method is also removed.</p>
    <p>Version 3 introduced new method: <a href="/docs/acceptParticipationRequest/" class="code">acceptParticipationRequest</a>. Which is similar to this.</p>
