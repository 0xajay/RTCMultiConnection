    <p>This event was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this event is also removed.</p>
    <p>Please check this demo instead: <a href="https://rtcmulticonnection.herokuapp.com/demos/share-part-of-screen.html">demos/share-part-of-screen.html</a></p>
